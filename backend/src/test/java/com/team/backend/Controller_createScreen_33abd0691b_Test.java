/*
To validate the business logic in the `createScreen` method, we need to consider various test scenarios that encapsulate the expected behavior, potential edge cases, and error conditions. Here are several test scenarios that should be considered:

1. **Valid Input Scenario:**
   - Description: Provide a valid `Screen` object in the request body and verify that the method creates a new screen with a generated ObjectId and persists it to the repository.
   - Expected Result: The returned `Screen` object should have a non-null `_id` field, and the repository should contain the new screen.

2. **Validation Check:**
   - Description: Attempt to create a screen with an invalid `Screen` object (one that does not pass the `@Valid` annotation constraints).
   - Expected Result: The method should throw a validation exception, and no new screen should be persisted in the repository.

3. **Missing Request Body:**
   - Description: Call the `createScreen` method without providing a request body.
   - Expected Result: The method should throw an error due to the missing request body, and no screen should be created.

4. **Null Input Scenario:**
   - Description: Pass a `null` value as the request body to the `createScreen` method.
   - Expected Result: The method should throw an error due to the invalid input, and no screen should be created.

5. **Repository Interaction:**
   - Description: Verify that the repository's `save` method is being called with the correct `Screen` object.
   - Expected Result: The repository should be invoked with the screen that has the newly generated ObjectId.

6. **ObjectId Generation:**
   - Description: Ensure that the `_id` field is being set with a new, unique ObjectId for each screen created.
   - Expected Result: Every created screen should have a unique `_id` field that is not null.

7. **Persistence Confirmation:**
   - Description: Confirm that the screen is actually persisted in the repository after the `save` call.
   - Expected Result: After the method completes, the screen should be retrievable from the repository.

8. **Response Check:**
   - Description: Verify that the screen returned by the `createScreen` method matches the screen that was intended to be saved.
   - Expected Result: The returned screen should have the same data as the input screen, except for the `_id` field, which should be set by the method.

9. **Exception Handling:**
   - Description: Simulate a scenario where the repository throws an exception during the save operation.
   - Expected Result: The method should handle the exception appropriately, possibly by logging the error and/or rethrowing a higher-level exception.

10. **Idempotency Check:**
    - Description: Call the `createScreen` method multiple times with the same `Screen` object to verify that each call generates a new screen with a different ObjectId.
    - Expected Result: Each call should result in a new screen being created with a different `_id`.

11. **Concurrent Creation:**
    - Description: Simulate concurrent calls to the `createScreen` method to ensure that ObjectId generation and screen creation are thread-safe.
    - Expected Result: Concurrent calls should not result in any errors or collisions, and each screen should have a unique `_id`.

12. **Performance Benchmark:**
    - Description: Measure the time it takes to create a screen to ensure that the method performs within acceptable limits.
    - Expected Result: The method should complete within a predefined time frame under normal load conditions.

These test scenarios cover a range of conditions that the `createScreen` method should handle correctly. While this list is not exhaustive, it provides a solid foundation for ensuring that the method functions as intended and handles various input and error conditions appropriately.
