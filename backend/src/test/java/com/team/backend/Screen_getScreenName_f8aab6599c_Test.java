/*
To properly validate the business logic of the `getScreenName` method, we should consider various test scenarios that could affect the outcome of this method. However, since the provided code snippet is incomplete and does not show the full context of the `screenName` variable, I will assume that `screenName` is a private member of the class and that it is properly initialized and set elsewhere in the code.

Here are some test scenarios that could be considered:

1. **Default Value Test**
   - Scenario: The `screenName` has not been explicitly set after object initialization.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the default value for `screenName` (which could be `null` or an empty string, depending on the implementation).

2. **Normal Value Test**
   - Scenario: The `screenName` is set to a typical, valid string value.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the exact string that was set.

3. **Empty String Test**
   - Scenario: The `screenName` is explicitly set to an empty string.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return an empty string.

4. **Null Value Test**
   - Scenario: The `screenName` is set to `null`.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return `null`, assuming `null` is a permissible value.

5. **Special Characters Test**
   - Scenario: The `screenName` contains special characters or symbols.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the string with special characters intact.

6. **Unicode Characters Test**
   - Scenario: The `screenName` contains Unicode characters (e.g., non-ASCII characters).
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the string with Unicode characters intact.

7. **Length Test**
   - Scenario: The `screenName` is set to a string that is unusually long or exceeds expected length limits.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should handle long strings correctly, either by returning the full string or truncating it according to the defined business logic.

8. **Concurrent Access Test**
   - Scenario: Multiple threads are accessing and potentially modifying the `screenName`.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return a consistent value even in the presence of concurrent access, assuming thread safety is a requirement.

9. **Persistence/Reload Test**
   - Scenario: The object containing `screenName` is persisted (e.g., to a database) and then reloaded.
   - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the same value for `screenName` after reload as it did before persistence.

10. **Case Sensitivity Test**
    - Scenario: The `screenName` is set with varying cases (e.g., all uppercase, all lowercase, mixed case).
    - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the string with case preserved, unless there is specific business logic to alter the case.

11. **Whitespace Test**
    - Scenario: The `screenName` contains leading, trailing, or internal whitespace.
    - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the string with whitespace intact, unless the business logic specifies trimming or normalization of whitespace.

12. **Injection/Escape Characters Test**
    - Scenario: The `screenName` contains SQL injection or script injection attempts.
    - Expected Result: The `getScreenName` method should return the string as-is, assuming it is not responsible for sanitizing input. Sanitization should occur at the point of input, not on retrieval.

For each of these scenarios, the test should compare the expected result with the actual result obtained from calling the `getScreenName` method and assert whether they match. If any of the tests fail, it would indicate a potential issue with the implementation of the method or the business logic surrounding the `screenName`.
