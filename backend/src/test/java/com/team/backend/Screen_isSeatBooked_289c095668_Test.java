/*
To validate the `isSeatBooked()` function, we should consider various scenarios to ensure that the business logic is thoroughly tested. However, it's important to note that the provided code snippet is incomplete and does not give us full context about how `seatBooked` is set or updated. Assuming `seatBooked` is a boolean member field of a class that represents a seat in a theater, airplane, or similar, here are some test scenarios:

1. **Initial State Validation:**
   - Verify that a newly created seat object has `seatBooked` set to `false` (assuming seats are not booked by default).

2. **State After Booking:**
   - Verify that after a seat is successfully booked, `isSeatBooked()` returns `true`.
   - Ensure that if booking a seat fails due to some business rule, `isSeatBooked()` still returns `false`.

3. **Concurrency Handling:**
   - Simulate multiple simultaneous booking requests for the same seat and ensure that only one booking succeeds and `isSeatBooked()` reflects the correct state after all requests are processed.

4. **Persistence Consistency:**
   - Verify that the `isSeatBooked()` method returns the correct booked state after the seat booking state has been persisted and then retrieved from a data store (e.g., a database).

5. **Seat Release:**
   - If there's functionality to cancel a booking, test that after a seat booking is canceled, `isSeatBooked()` returns `false`.

6. **Invalid State:**
   - If applicable, test how `isSeatBooked()` handles cases where the seat object is in an invalid state (e.g., uninitialized or corrupted data).

7. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - If the system has a limit on the number of seats that can be booked, verify that `isSeatBooked()` correctly reflects the booked state when at the boundary conditions (e.g., last seat being booked).

8. **Seat Re-booking:**
   - Verify that if a seat has been booked and then released, it can be successfully re-booked and `isSeatBooked()` should return `true` after re-booking.

9. **Performance Under Load:**
   - Test how the `isSeatBooked()` function performs under heavy load conditions. This would typically be a stress test to ensure that the function remains responsive and accurate when many instances are being checked concurrently.

10. **Integration with Other Components:**
    - Validate that `isSeatBooked()` works correctly when integrated with other components of the system, such as payment processing or user authentication.

11. **State Consistency After System Restart:**
    - Test the persistence of the `seatBooked` state after a system restart to ensure that `isSeatBooked()` still returns the correct value.

12. **API Contract Adherence:**
    - If `isSeatBooked()` is part of a public API, verify that it adheres to its contract in terms of input, output, and side effects.

13. **Exception Handling:**
    - Ensure that `isSeatBooked()` handles any potential exceptions gracefully and does not throw unexpected exceptions.

Each of these scenarios would require specific setup and validation steps to ensure that `isSeatBooked()` behaves as expected. Additionally, the actual test code would depend on the context in which `seatBooked` is being managed within the system.
