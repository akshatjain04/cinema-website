/*
To validate the business logic of the `setScreenName` method, we need to consider various test scenarios. However, it's worth noting that the code snippet provided is not enough to fully understand the context of the `setScreenName` method. Assuming that this method is part of a larger class, which might represent a user profile or a similar entity, here are potential test scenarios:

1. **Standard Screen Name Assignment:**
   - Scenario: Assign a valid screen name and verify that it is set correctly.
   - Expected Result: The `screenName` field should reflect the new value.

2. **Null Screen Name:**
   - Scenario: Pass a `null` value to the `setScreenName` method.
   - Expected Result: Depending on the business logic, the `screenName` should either accept `null` or throw an exception (e.g., `IllegalArgumentException`).

3. **Empty String Screen Name:**
   - Scenario: Pass an empty string (`""`) as the screen name.
   - Expected Result: The method should handle the empty string appropriately, either by setting the `screenName` to an empty string or by throwing a validation error.

4. **Screen Name with Special Characters:**
   - Scenario: Pass a screen name with special characters (e.g., `@!#%&*`).
   - Expected Result: The method should either accept, sanitize, or reject the input based on the defined business rules for screen names.

5. **Screen Name with Leading or Trailing Whitespace:**
   - Scenario: Pass a screen name with leading or trailing spaces (e.g., `"  username  "`).
   - Expected Result: The method should trim the whitespace or reject the input if whitespace is not allowed.

6. **Maximum Length Constraint:**
   - Scenario: Pass a screen name that exceeds the maximum allowed length.
   - Expected Result: The method should reject the input or truncate it to the maximum length, depending on the business logic.

7. **Minimum Length Constraint:**
   - Scenario: Pass a screen name that is shorter than the minimum allowed length.
   - Expected Result: The method should reject the input if it does not meet the minimum length requirement.

8. **Concurrent Access:**
   - Scenario: Simulate concurrent calls to `setScreenName` to ensure thread safety.
   - Expected Result: The field `screenName` should be consistently set even when accessed by multiple threads concurrently.

9. **Persistence Verification:**
   - Scenario: After setting the screen name, save the object (assuming it's part of a larger entity that gets persisted) and retrieve it to verify the screen name is persisted correctly.
   - Expected Result: The retrieved object should have the same screen name that was set.

10. **Screen Name Uniqueness:**
    - Scenario: Set a screen name that is already used by another user/entity (assuming there's a uniqueness constraint).
    - Expected Result: The method should reject the duplicate screen name if uniqueness is enforced.

11. **Unicode and International Characters:**
    - Scenario: Pass a screen name with Unicode or international characters (e.g., Chinese, Arabic, Emoji).
    - Expected Result: The method should handle international characters as per the business requirements, either by accepting, encoding, or rejecting them.

12. **Screen Name Update:**
    - Scenario: Update an existing screen name to a new value.
    - Expected Result: The `screenName` field should be updated to the new value, and any related business logic (e.g., updating related records, notifying followers) should be triggered.

These scenarios cover a range of possible inputs and situations that the `setScreenName` method might encounter. Each scenario should be tested individually to ensure that the method behaves correctly and meets the requirements of the business logic.
