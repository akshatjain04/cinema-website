/*
To validate the business logic of the `setSeatBooked` function, we need to consider the context in which this method operates. The method appears to be a simple setter, changing the state of a `seatBooked` attribute in an object, likely a seat reservation system. Given the information, here are some test scenarios:

1. **Test seat booking status change:**
   - Scenario: Set an initially unbooked seat to booked.
   - Expected Result: The `seatBooked` attribute should change from `false` to `true`.

2. **Test seat unbooking status change:**
   - Scenario: Set an initially booked seat to unbooked.
   - Expected Result: The `seatBooked` attribute should change from `true` to `false`.

3. **Verify immutability of other object attributes:**
   - Scenario: Ensure that changing the `seatBooked` status does not inadvertently modify other attributes of the object (like `id`, `seatNumber`, etc.).
   - Expected Result: No other attributes except `seatBooked` should change.

4. **Test method with invalid input:**
   - Scenario: Since the method takes a boolean, this scenario is not strictly applicable, but it's important to note that the method should handle non-boolean inputs if the method signature were to change.
   - Expected Result: The method should throw an appropriate exception or handle the invalid input gracefully.

5. **Concurrent access:**
   - Scenario: Test the method's behavior when multiple threads attempt to set `seatBooked` at the same time.
   - Expected Result: The final state of `seatBooked` should correspond to the last write operation, and the object should remain in a consistent state.

6. **Persistence check (if applicable):**
   - Scenario: If the `seatBooked` status is meant to be persisted (e.g., in a database), verify that the change is correctly saved.
   - Expected Result: The new value of `seatBooked` should be retrievable after the set operation, possibly after a simulated system restart or reload.

7. **Idempotency:**
   - Scenario: Set `seatBooked` to the same value it currently has.
   - Expected Result: The operation should not affect the system's state, and any related processes or side effects should not be triggered again.

8. **Event triggering (if applicable):**
   - Scenario: If setting the seat as booked or unbooked should trigger events or notifications (e.g., to a waitlist system or to update a seat map), verify that these are correctly triggered.
   - Expected Result: The appropriate events or notifications are fired when `seatBooked` changes.

9. **Boundary conditions:**
   - Scenario: If there is a maximum number of times a seat can be booked and unbooked, test reaching this limit.
   - Expected Result: The system should handle this boundary condition as expected, either by allowing or disallowing further changes to `seatBooked`.

10. **Check for side effects:**
    - Scenario: Verify that setting `seatBooked` doesn't cause any unintended side effects within the system (like affecting other seats or reservations).
    - Expected Result: No side effects are observed; only the intended `seatBooked` state is modified.

These scenarios assume that the method is part of a larger system and that it interacts with other components. The actual implementation of these tests would depend on the specifics of the system, including how the state of `seatBooked` is used and how the object is persisted and retrieved.
