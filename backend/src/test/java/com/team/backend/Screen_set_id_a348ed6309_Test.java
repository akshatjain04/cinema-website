/*
To validate the business logic of the `set_id` method, you would need to write test scenarios that cover various aspects of the method's expected behavior. Since the method itself is a simple setter, the scenarios will be straightforward. Here are some test scenarios to consider:

1. **Setting a Valid ID:**
   - **Scenario:** Set a valid `ObjectId` and ensure it is correctly assigned to the object.
   - **Expected Behavior:** After calling `set_id` with a valid `ObjectId`, the object's `_id` field should be equal to the `ObjectId` passed to the method.

2. **Setting a Null ID:**
   - **Scenario:** Call `set_id` with a `null` value.
   - **Expected Behavior:** After calling `set_id` with `null`, the object's `_id` field should be `null`. This scenario checks how the method handles `null` values.

3. **Setting a New ID on an Object with an Existing ID:**
   - **Scenario:** Call `set_id` on an object that already has an `_id` set to a different `ObjectId`.
   - **Expected Behavior:** The object's `_id` field should be updated to the new `ObjectId`. This scenario ensures that the method can update the `_id` field.

4. **Immutable ID Enforcement (if applicable):**
   - **Scenario:** If the business logic dictates that `_id` should be immutable after being set once, attempt to change the `_id` after it has been set.
   - **Expected Behavior:** The method should either throw an exception or ignore the new `ObjectId` value, depending on the defined behavior for immutability.

5. **ID Uniqueness Check (if applicable):**
   - **Scenario:** If the business logic requires that each object must have a unique `_id`, attempt to set an `_id` that is already known to be associated with another object.
   - **Expected Behavior:** The method should enforce uniqueness by either throwing an exception or rejecting the duplicate `ObjectId`, depending on the defined behavior for uniqueness.

6. **ID Format Validation (if applicable):**
   - **Scenario:** Pass an `ObjectId` with an incorrect format to the `set_id` method (for instance, a string that does not conform to the `ObjectId` specifications).
   - **Expected Behavior:** Since `ObjectId` is a type that inherently ensures format, this scenario might not be applicable. If there is additional format validation, the method should reject the incorrectly formatted `ObjectId`.

7. **Thread Safety Check (if applicable):**
   - **Scenario:** Call `set_id` concurrently from multiple threads to see if the method is thread-safe.
   - **Expected Behavior:** The `_id` field should be set correctly without any race conditions or data corruption.

8. **Persistence Layer Interaction (if applicable):**
   - **Scenario:** If the `set_id` method is expected to interact with a persistence layer (e.g., triggering an update in a database), test that this interaction occurs as expected.
   - **Expected Behavior:** The persistence layer should reflect the change in the `_id` field after the method is called.

Remember, these scenarios assume that you will be implementing them in test code using appropriate testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG, along with mocking frameworks like Mockito if needed to mock dependencies and interactions.
